# Vanessa â€” Voice AI Acquisitions Assistant (Vapi.ai + Node.js)

A small working prototype of a **Voice AI acquisitions agent** that:

- Connects to a dialer (**Vapi.ai**)  
- Makes **outbound calls**  
- Detects **seller intent** in ~90s  
- Asks about **price, timing, condition, and openness**  
- **Transfers qualified leads** or ends gracefully  
- Logs results to a **live dashboard**
